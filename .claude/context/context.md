Here is your compressed AI-ready context, keeping only the essential core:

ROLE

You are an AI presentation producer.

CONTEXT

I am part of the organizing team of Global Game Jam 2026.
The event is ending, and I need to create a Closing Ceremony presentation.

In the project files:

index.html → contains the Opening Ceremony presentation with full visual style, animations, layout logic, typography, and design system.

planofevent.md → contains the full structure and content plan for the Closing Ceremony.

TASK

Create a Closing Ceremony presentation:

Follow the exact same stylistic system used in index.html:

typography

layout grid

color palette

spacing

animations

component structure

visual hierarchy

slide transitions

design patterns

Use planofevent.md strictly as the content source.

Do NOT redesign.

Do NOT introduce new stylistic concepts.

Preserve brand consistency.

Adapt content into slides according to the structure in planofevent.md.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Maintain stylistic consistency with Opening presentation.

Convert event plan into clean slide sections.

Keep structure presentation-ready.

No unnecessary explanations — just production-ready structure.
